# Introduction 📖
Depression is a widespread mental disorder affecting people globally, with notable disparities across different genders and regions. Recognizing the value of digital platforms in early detection, the aim of this project is to predict signs of user-generated depressive posts on SNS< enhancing the detection of mental health issues in digital communication spaces. With the implementation of NLP, the researcher leverages advanced models and extensive SNS data to address this critical health concern effectively. 

# Aim & Objectives 🎯
**Aim**: To predict signs of user-generated depressive posts on SNS, enhancing the detection of mental health issues in digital communication spaces.

**Objectives**:
* To generate a dataset by collecting 30,000 user-generated depressive and non-depressive posts from various social networking sites.
* To perform a hybrid approach for data labelling that integrates manual labelling and transfer learning.
* To implement and evaluate four deep learning models.
* To deploy the most effective model with at least 80% predictive accuracy into a web application.

# Dataset 🛢️
The dataset is manually collected by the owner from the Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit sites, which can be retrieved via the [Data Source.zip](Data%20Source.zip). It consists of a total of 41,273 samples.

# Data Collection Tool 🛠️
* Twitter API
* Postman Collection
